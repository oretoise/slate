    <span style="color: #660000; text-decoration: underline;"><b>BULLDOG</b></span><br/>
    MSU athletic teams are called Bulldogs, a name earned and maintained over the decades by the tough, tenacious play by student-athletes wearing the maroon and white. The official school mascot is an American Kennel Club-registered English bulldog given the inherited title of "Bully."  The current mascot is named "Jak" or Bully XXI and is the son of "Champ," Bully XX.

    <span style="color: #660000; text-decoration: underline;"><b>COWBELL</b></span><br/>
    The cowbell is the longstanding visual and auditory symbol of Mississippi State pride.  Legend has it a wandering Jersey cow became a good luck charm in the mid-20th century after having strolled onto the field during an ultimately victorious home football game. Over time, students began ringing cowbells for continued luck at outdoor athletic events, starting a tradition that continues in the modern era.

    <span style="color: #660000; text-decoration: underline;"><b>MAROON & WHITE</b></span><br/>
    Maroon and white are MSUâ€™s colors dating back to November 16, 1895. <span style="color: #660000; text-decoration: underline;"><b>MAROON FRIDAY</b></span> became a tradition as Bulldogs around the world began expressing their pride and passion for MSU by wearing at least one piece of maroon clothing each Friday.
</p>

<p>I look forward to your becoming an MSU Bulldog, and I am always here to help!</p>
<p>All the best,</p>
