<h3>Day 5 - Subject: Important info about licensure and MATS at MSU!</h3>
<p>Dear @@{{First}},</p>

<p>Thank you again for your interest in our distance Master of Arts in Teachingâ€”Secondary Teacher Alternative Route (MATS) at Mississippi State University (MSU).</p>

<p>I wanted to share some important information, regarding <b>licensure</b>:  Please be aware that teacher licensure is state-mandated. This means that as a Mississippi institution, we can only grant a Mississippi teaching license.</p>

<p>If you are not a Mississippi resident, before you apply to this program, you will need to check with the state department of education where you want to teach and ask them about reciprocity for a MS teaching license. They will explain the process to turn your MS teaching license into a license to teach in the state of your choice.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we are no longer able to place students in <b>Georgia</b> for an internship.</p>

<p><b>Good news:</b>  You can earn your initial licensure and then teach full time in the state of MS while completing the MATS degree online!  Our licensure and endorsements page provides detailed information regarding that process.</p>

<p>Let me know what questions you have.  I'm happy to help you get started with making a difference in the lives of our youth as a teacher!</p>
<p>All the best,</p>
