<h3>Day 24 - Subject: Hear from our Online MBA-PM Students</h3>

<p>What do our program students have to say about the online MBA Project Management program?</p>

<p><i>"I chose an accredited, highly ranked, and convenient online learning program. MSU's program provided high flexibility for a working professional, like myself; who wanted to do more with their career. The system was always available, the staff were responsive and there were many orientations and instructions to get me acquainted with the system. My experience with MSU is of the most enjoyable learning experiences I had ever had throughout my life."</i></p>

<p><i>"MSUâ€™s distance program was the only online degree program that made me feel like an actual student, rather than someone who was just trying to earn a degree. The entire staff made me feel like a welcome member of the Bulldog family way before I even completed my application. I loved the school and curriculum so much that MSU was the only school I applied to pursue my MBA-Project Management degree. I am so glad I chose MSState Online and have recommended it to everyone I know: I even got one of my employees to apply as well!"</i></p>

<p><i>"I chose online at Mississippi State because it was the perfect mix of cost, quality, and specialization. For a top 20 online MBA, it's incredibly affordable. The project management concentration was directly relevant to my job as a quality engineer. For a manufacturing engineer like me, looking to go back to school for a business degree while still working, I couldn't find a better program. And I compared a lot of programs."</i></p>
