<h3>Day 0 - Subject: Visualize your future with a Vision Specialist in Vocational Rehabilitation certificate at MSU!</h3>

<p>Dear @@{{First}},</p>

<p>Thank you for your interest in the Vision Specialist in Vocational Rehabilitation certificate (VSP) at Mississippi State University (MSU)!</p>

<p>This program provides vocational rehabilitation (VR) counselors, therapists, and graduate students enrolled in VR programs with the expertise to address issues specific to visual impairment.</p>

<p><b>How does the online VSP work?</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>All online students pay in-state tuition.</li>
    <li>Certificate Program includes four online education <a href="https://online.msstate.edu/vision#courses">graduate courses</a>, including a 100 hour practicum.</li>
    <li><b>Great news:</b>  Starting with the class of 2020, the three-week residency component is <b>no longer required!</b>  All coursework will be online with some activities conducted in agencies that are serving individuals who are blind or visually impaired.</li>
    <li>Students begin online coursework in the spring and continue through the summer and fall semesters (January - December).</li>
    <li>Application Deadline for spring semester only: <b>October 1st.</b></li>
</ul>

<p>All courses are taught by faculty and staff from MSU.  Because MSU is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC), your classes will meet the same standards as those on-campus.  Also, your online degree will not be differentiated from an on-campus degree.</p>

<p>Are you ready to <a href="https://online.msstate.edu/vision#admissions-process">apply</a>?  If you have any questions or concerns, please contact me, and I will be glad to assist you.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
