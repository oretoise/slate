<p>Dear @{{First}},</p>

<p>
    <img class="img-right" src="https://goto.msstate.edu/www/images/Distance/Email%20Template/orientation.png"/>
    If you're worried about how you will complete online coursework or how to navigate your courses, don't fret!
</p>

<p>
    Once you have been admitted, Mississippi State University offers a non-credit <a href="http://distance.msstate.edu/{{$program}}/orientation"><i>Online@State Orientation</i></a> course to new distance students at no charge?  This course allows students to become familiar with the online learning process at MSU before their courses actually begin.
</p>

<p>
    Of course, I am also here whenever you have a question.
</p>

<p>
    I look forward to hearing from you!
</p>

<p>
    All the best,
</p>
